Analysis of variants in gulf coast tick beetles for Becky.

#Methods

###Library preperation and sequencing

###Alignment to other species
Genomes for *H. Sapien* GRCh38, *R. parkeri* NC_017044.1, and *B. Taurus* Btau_5.0.1 were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnolgy's website and were used to generate databases for BLAST queries (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). UNEAK tag pairs were extracted from Tassel results and converted into fasta format. The UNEAK tags were used as queries against each of the genomes.
